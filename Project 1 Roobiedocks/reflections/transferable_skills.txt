I graduated from university 9 months ago and just graduated from data analyst nanodegree. This is my second nanodegree and I really love learning new stuff. 
I'm not working right now but have some industrial engineering internship experiences and also worked as a freelance team guide at Udacity
+I know Python, C, R, SQL and VBA. I think these skills will help me a lot during this nanodegree
+As I'm not working right now, I have plenty of time to study this nanodegree, which will also increase my focus and efficiency on this nanodegree
